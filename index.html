     <h1>Happy 6 Months, Love! 💕</h1>
    <p>Every moment with you is a memory I cherish. From the moment we met, you’ve filled my life with joy, laughter, and love. Every day with you feels like a beautiful adventure, and I’m endlessly grateful for every second we share. Six months may seem short in time, but when I think of all the memories we’ve made, it feels like we’ve lived a lifetime together already. You make everything better, just by being yourself.
These moments we've captured are just a glimpse of the love and happiness you bring into my life. With you, every day is a celebration.
Here’s to us — to the memories we’ve created, the love we’ve built, and the countless moments ahead. I love you more than words can express, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us. </p>
    <p>Here's to us!</p>

 <h3>Then we met. My brain and body froze, literally! I somehow knew that I have met my soulmate. Like that song - </h3>

<h2> Pehli nazar me kaisa jaadu kaar diya, Tera ban baitha hai mera jiya </h2>
<h2> Jaane kya hoga, kya hoga kya pata, Iss pal ko milke aa jeele zara </h2>

<h3>Finally! I was so happy that I extended my 3 days stay to almost a week. We ate, slept, walked on the beach, walked the streets of Mumbai, rode the metro, rickshaw and cab ride. Also watched a film together, which had made everyone cry, except for us two 😂 </h3>
 <h2>You also hugged me 3 times and I kissed you on your forehead 😘</h2>
 <h3> But it wasn't meant to be at that time, we left it to fate (well I did) and put it in the universe that we'll revisit us in 2 years and see how things are. </h3>

<h1> </h1>

<h3> And wanna guess what happens? Lo and behold, we met exactly after 2 years and you felt the spark and took the leap of faith. Then what you ask? </h3>
<h2> Then it resulted in te most beautiful 6 months of my life! </h2>
<h1> </h1>
<h3> You already were my favourite person in the world, but it was starting to be more. To make this feeling even stronger, you sent me your cutes like these - </h3>

<h3> Oh no no, I didn't enact a scene from a film standing on a wood log thinking it's Mount Everest.</h3>
<h2> This is where I first said "I LOVE YOU" to you, well you were not there to listen, but I put it out in the universe and then nothing was the same. </h2>
<h3> Then nothing was the same. Soon I confessed to you how I feel, actually the same day in the evening. I remember the sky, the stars, the trees from that day, as if I'm seeing it right now. Well, I am 😬 you also see -</h3>

<h3> Beautiful na? I know it is,  after all I've clicked it 😁. Oh sorry, the night, yes, it was a very beautiful night because </h3>
<h2> you also reciprocated my feelings!!! Yay! </h2> 
<h3> We both were so happy. Then what happened is what was destined all along. We chatted, voice called till 4 AM at night, everyday. </h3>

<h3>Yes, I was upset and you came and sat next to me but you also didn't talk. So we were just sitting there waiting for the other to say/do something 😆</h3>
<h3> Then something hapened, yes, you know what - 💋. And it was so mast, I till remember the feeling and the whole chain of events like it was yesterday. No, I don't have a picture that I'm looking at, but I don't need one. It's printed in my brain for life! </h3>
<h3> And then some more 🙌. The next 16 days were (and are) the best days of my life. Then sleeping together, continuous hugging and kissing, watching TV, showering, forehead kisses, exploring Mumbai, late night snacks, dancing/ me giving you lap dance, getting matching watches...damn, I want it all again! Here, you also take a look -" </h3>
